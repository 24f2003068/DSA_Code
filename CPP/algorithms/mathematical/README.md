## Dinic's Algorithm for Maximum Flow

Dinic's algorithm is an efficient algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network, improving on the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. It runs in O(VÂ²E) time and is much faster in practice for many problems.

### Key Concepts

1. **Flow Network**: A directed graph where each edge has a capacity and a flow, with source and sink vertices.
2. **Level Graph**: A graph where vertices are assigned levels according to their shortest distance from the source.
3. **Blocking Flow**: A flow where every path from source to sink has at least one saturated edge.

### Algorithm Steps

1. Create a level graph using BFS
2. Find blocking flows using DFS 
3. Repeat until no more augmenting paths can be found

### Applications

- Network Flow Problems
- Bipartite Matching
- Image Segmentation
- Circulation Problems
- Scheduling Problems

### Usage Example

```cpp
// Create a flow network with 6 vertices
DinicMaxFlow network(6);

// Add edges (from, to, capacity)
network.addEdge(0, 1, 16);
network.addEdge(0, 2, 13);
// ... more edges ...

// Calculate maximum flow from source (0) to sink (5)
int maxFlow = network.maxFlow(0, 5);
```
