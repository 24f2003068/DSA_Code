Karatsuba Algorithm for Multiplying Large Numbers

Problem Statement:
The challenge of multiplying large numbers efficiently is crucial in computer science and numerical computations. 
Traditional multiplication methods have a time complexity of O(n^2), where n is the number of digits in the numbers being multiplied. 
As the size of the numbers increases, the time taken to perform multiplication grows quadratically.

Theory:
The Karatsuba algorithm, developed by Anatolii Alexeevitch Karatsuba, is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that reduces the 
multiplication of two n-digit numbers to at most three multiplications of n/2-digit numbers, 
along with some additional additions and shifts. This method reduces the time complexity to approximately O(n^(log2 3)) â‰ˆ O(n^1.585), 
making it significantly faster for large numbers.

The algorithm involves the following steps:
1. Split each number into two halves.
2. Recursively compute three products:
   - ac (product of the most significant parts)
   - bd (product of the least significant parts)
   - (a + b)(c + d)
3. Combine the results to get the final product.
